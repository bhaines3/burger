# Project Name - Eat-Da-Burger
Description: Creating a burger logger with MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars and a homemade ORM (yum!). Following the design pattern and using Node + MySQL to query and route data in your app, and Handlebars to generate your HTML.
Designed to be used as a communication tool for fellow developers in the community and potential employers. 

# Usage
1) Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
2) Whenever a user submits a burger's name, your app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
3) Each burger in the waiting area also has a "devour it!" button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page as it is devoured.
4) Your app will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.
